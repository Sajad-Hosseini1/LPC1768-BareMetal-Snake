🐍 Snake Game on LPC1768 (Bare-Metal)

This repository contains a classic Snake game implemented for the LPC1768 (ARM Cortex-M3) microcontroller using Bare-Metal Embedded C.

The project is written without any RTOS, directly on top of CMSIS, and was developed and tested using the Keil uVision Emulator.
